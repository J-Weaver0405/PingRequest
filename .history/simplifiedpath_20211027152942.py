The Simplified Path Finding Problem
Given an N  NÃ—N matrix of blocks with a source upper left block, we want to find a path from the source to the destination(the lower right block). We can only move downwards and to the right. Also a path is given by 11 and a wall is given by 00.

if we have arrived at the end of the grid,

    check right 
        see if right is equal to 0 
    check down 
        see if it is equal to 0 

movements: downwards, rights
upper left block: 0,0
